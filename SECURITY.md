# Security Policy

## Scope

Logbook is designed for local development workflows and is not a production observability service.
Security issues are still taken seriously, especially around data handling and local HTTP ingest behavior.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are currently provided for:

- `main` (latest)

Older revisions are not guaranteed to receive backports.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.

Preferred reporting path:

1. Open a private GitHub Security Advisory for this repository.
2. Include reproduction steps, affected version/commit, and impact.

If private advisory reporting is unavailable, open an issue with minimal details and request a private contact channel.

## Response Targets

- Initial triage acknowledgment: within 7 days
- Follow-up with severity and next steps: as soon as triage is complete

## Disclosure

Please allow time for a fix before public disclosure. Coordinated disclosure is appreciated.
